# Data-Pipeline-and-Web-App-Exercise-Prescriptions
## Data Pipeline and Web Application for Exercise Workout App
This is a full data pipeline developed from personal excel spreadsheets created during the time as a personal trainer. The web application is designed for fitness clients to access their personally designed workouts.

## Web Application
The web application is accessible through the following link: https://jaredap1995-data-pipeline-and-web-app-exerci-workout-app-xhbr64.streamlit.app/

The application allows clients to access any one of their hundreds of personally designed workouts, record and track their progress throughout the workouts and training blocks. Previously clients had to navigate to a Google Sheet and manually fill in details for their workout, while the trainer manually tracked their progress. The Web application automates this process.

## Data Pipeline
The pipeline was necessary because of the nature of the messy raw excel files, which were never designed with the intention of data extraction. The pipeline was created by engineering the data in Jupyter and Python and uploading the cleaned information to a postgreSQL database that can be called upon by the web application when the user enters their name.

## Challenges and Progress
Various challenges were encountered, including the nature of the data, the best way to set up the database, and the best approach to developing logic rules for exercise prescription.

Any files with the word "Exploratory" are my personal unedited, unformatted Jupyter Notebooks that showcase the process of developing subsequent functions and modules.

## Future Features
More features are in development, and I will also be doing side data analysis projects examining what kind of exercises I prescribe the most, how those exercises have changed over time, and which clients have reached the greatest volume loads over time!
